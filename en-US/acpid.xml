	<title>acpid</title>
	<para>
	  <application>acpid</application> is a daemon that monitors <firstterm>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</firstterm> (ACPI) events and executes scripts to respond to them. These events are typically prompted by the user interacting with the hardware, such as closing a laptop lid or pressing the power button. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  <application>acpid</application> executes actions based on rules you establish. Certain rules are predefined on installation but can be altered. These rules are set in configuration files created in <filename>/etc/acpi/events</filename>.
	</para>  
	<para>
	   Each file must define an event and an action on separate lines for each rule. The <computeroutput>event=</computeroutput> line identifies the hardware interaction to be configured. The <computeroutput>action=</computeroutput> line specifies a shell script containing the configuration, which you must create (typically in <filename>/etc/acpi/actions</filename>). Multiple rules can be set for each event, or one rule for multiple events. 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  <application>acpid</application> ships with one shell script at <filename>/etc/acpi/actions/power.sh</filename> and two configuration files in <filename>/etc/acpi/events</filename>: <filename>powerconf</filename> and <filename>videoconf</filename>. <filename>powerconf</filename> is structured as follows:
	</para>  
<programlisting>
# ACPID config to power down machine if powerbutton is pressed, but only if 
# no gnome-power-manager is running
	      
event=button/power.*
action=/etc/acpi/actions/power.sh
</programlisting>
	<para>
	  <application>acpid</application> is installed by default in some, but not all Fedora installations.
