<para>
	 All CPUfreq drivers are built in and selected automatically, so to set up CPUfreq you just need to select a governor.
</para>
       
<para>
	You can view which governors are available for use for a specific CPU using:
</para>

<screen><command>cpupower frequency-info --governors</command></screen>

<para>
	You can then enable one of these governors on all CPUs using:
</para>

<screen><command>cpupower frequency-set --governor <replaceable>[governor]</replaceable></command></screen>

<para>
	To only enable a governor on specific cores, use <command>-c</command> with a range or comma-separated list of CPU numbers. For example, to enable the Userspace governor for CPUs 1-3 and 5, the command would be:
</para>  
  
<screen><command>cpupower -c 1-3,5 frequency-set --governor cpufreq_userspace</command></screen>
