	<para>
		<firstterm>Aggressive Link Power Management</firstterm> (ALPM) is a power-saving technique that helps the disk save power by setting a SATA link to the disk to a low-power setting during idle time (that is when there is no I/O). ALPM automatically sets the SATA link back to an active power state once I/O requests are queued to that link.
	</para>
	<para>
		Power savings introduced by ALPM come at the expense of disk latency. As such, you should only use ALPM if you expect the system to experience long periods of idle I/O time.

	<para>
		ALPM is only available on SATA controllers that use the <firstterm>Advanced Host Controller Interface</firstterm> (AHCI). For more information about AHCI, refer to <ulink url="http://www.intel.com/technology/serialata/ahci.htm"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		When available, ALPM is enabled by default. ALPM has three modes:

</indexterm>	
	<para>This mode sets the link to its lowest power state (SLUMBER) when there is no I/O on the disk. This mode is useful for times when an extended period of idle time is expected.</para>

<indexterm>
<primary>PARTIAL</primary>
<secondary>Aggressive Link Power Management</secondary>
</indexterm>	
	<para>This mode sets the link to the second lowest power state (PARTIAL) when there is no I/O on the disk. This mode is designed to allow transitions in link power states (for example during times of intermittent heavy I/O and idle I/O) with as small impact on performance as possible.</para>
</formalpara>

	<para><command>medium_power</command> mode allows the link to transition between PARTIAL and fully-powered (that is "ACTIVE") states, depending on the load. Note that it is not possible to transition a link directly from PARTIAL to SLUMBER and back; in this case, either power state cannot transition to the other without transitioning through the ACTIVE state first.</para>

	<para>ALPM is disabled; the link does not enter any low-power state when there is no I/O on the disk.</para>
</formalpara>	

<para>To check whether your SATA host adapters actually support ALPM you can check if the file <filename>/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy</filename> exists. To change the settings simply write the values described in this section to these files or display the files to check for the current setting.</para>
