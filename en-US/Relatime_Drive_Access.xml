	<title>Relatime Drive Access Optimization</title>
	<para>
		The POSIX standard requires that operating systems maintain file system metadata that records when each file was last accessed. This timestamp is called <systemitem>atime</systemitem>, and maintaining it requires a constant series of write operations to storage. These writes keep storage devices and their links busy and powered up. Since few applications make use of the <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data, this storage device activity wastes power. Significantly, the write to storage would occur even if the file was not read from storage, but from cache. For some time, the Linux kernel has supported a <option>noatime</option> option for <application>mount</application> and would not write <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data to file systems mounted with this option. However, simply turning off this feature is problematic because some applications rely on <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data and will fail if it is not available.

		The kernel used in Fedora&nbsp;&PRODVER; supports another alternative â€” <option>relatime</option>. <option>Relatime</option> maintains <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data, but not for each time that a file is accessed. With this option enabled, <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data is written to the disk only if the file has been modified since the <systemitem>atime</systemitem> data was last updated (<systemitem>mtime</systemitem>), or if the file was last accessed more than a certain length of time ago (by default, one day). 
	</para>
	<para>
		By default, all filesystems are now mounted with <option>relatime</option> enabled. You can suppress it for any particular file system by mounting that file system with the option <option>norelatime</option>.
